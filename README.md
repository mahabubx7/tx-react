# TxJS + React (SPA)

> I made this to have an express app boilerplate that can give me better DX and can keep me productive. Now, added React v18 and configured with SPA mode.

Thanks to 🤝 `tsoa`, it helped me a lot by managing swagger-openapi easily more than ever I did on my own.

### Key Features

- Node.js LTS v20.x or later (recommended)
- ES Modules based `esm` mode (type: `module`)
- Build target: `ES2022`
- Special thanks to `esbuild`. The game changer 🔥
- React.js (v18)
- JSX (`.tsx`) and TailwindCSS
- Only one server for both
